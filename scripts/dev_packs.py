"""Development builds as a base and small packs over it: build the game once, then build only what a change touches and run it
from a copy of that base. For development and A/B tests only: it calls nx2/make_game.py and nx2/build.py as they are and
changes nothing in what players build (docs/development.md, *Testing a change against a base*).

    python -I scripts/dev_packs.py base <dir> --romfs <romfs> --exefs <exefs> [--seed <game folder>] [--predict-s N]
        Build this checkout (no uncommitted or untracked sources: a base is a commit) into <dir>/game, keeping its work folder
        <dir>/work. --seed copies the shader caches of an earlier game folder first, as a player's update keeps them: they are
        stamped by the shader translator, so the prepare redoes only what changed instead of starting cold. --predict-s N
        (development only; 0, the default, builds them all) stops building the whole game's predicted pipelines after N
        seconds (RX_VK_PREDICT_S): the rest are built in play when first drawn, so warm the base for the scenes you test.
    python -I scripts/dev_packs.py warm <dir> --run "<command with {runtime}>" [--run ...]
        Play a runtime with no pack once per --run command (split as a POSIX shell would; {runtime} is its folder; it uses
        <dir>/warm-runtime when rt made it there beforehand), copy the caches play made or grew back into the base's game
        folder, and delete the runtime: every later runtime starts warm for those scenes.
    python -I scripts/dev_packs.py adopt <dir> --work <work> --game <game> --romfs <romfs> --exefs <exefs>
        Use a full build of this checkout's commit that already exists (built with HOOKSHOT_KEEP_BUILD_FILES=1) as the base.
    python -I scripts/dev_packs.py pack <dir> <name> [--tree <checkout>] [--prepare | --no-prepare]
        Build a change (a checkout whose history contains the base's commit; committed, uncommitted and untracked files all
        count) into <dir>/packs/<name>:
          - only renderer files the game is not built from (gpu/vk/ and the renderer's third_party, but renderer_read_by_game):
            the renderer alone (RX_VK_ONLY: no lift, no game; seconds to minutes);
          - anything else: the game with make_game.py (HOOKSHOT_NO_PREPARE=1), which builds both modules, in one work folder
            shared by the base's packs (pack_folders), so after the first game pack the lift is skipped while the translator,
            the HLE list and the hot list stay the same.
        The pack keeps a module when an object it is linked from differs from the base's (module_changed), and any other file
        of the built game folder that differs from the base's (button prompts and the like). A runtime prepares again when the
        shader translator (what nx2/build.py stamps the shader caches with) or the shader seed changed.
    python -I scripts/dev_packs.py rt <dir> <runtime> [<pack>...]
        A game folder to run: the base's, its romfs hard-linked (read-only), the rest copied (the caches are written in play),
        the packs' files over it, prepared again if a pack needs it.
    python -I scripts/dev_packs.py ls <dir>

A pack's modules come from the same base as the rest of the runtime, so the game and the renderer always match
(MKWVK_API_VERSION). Two packs that bring the same file are refused: merge their branches and build one pack. base, pack, rt
and warm hold <dir>/dev_packs.busy while they run, so a second job on the same base is refused.
